# BookSmart

BookSmart is a feature-rich discussion forum, where people from around the world can share their thoughts and impressions about all forms of written literature.

## Features

By creating the app, we wanted to make sure that this is a place where both casual and passionate readers could find a friendly atmosphere. We have implemented number of features, that we think are crucial to achieve our goal:
- Accounts: User's account is a way to express their opinion, make connections with others and observe their progress since the moment they have joined the platform;
- Posts: Users can create STORY posts to initiate discussion about almost anything that is related to books, as well as ANNOUNCEMENTS, to let their friends know about starting or finishing a particular book;
- Leaderboard: Of course, when a person finishes reading a book, it is the end of yet another journey. But in our app, this accomplishment will be a primary indicator of user's place in Leaderboard;
- Badges: Users earn different kinds of badges for praticipating in discussions, using quotes, finishing books, etc.
